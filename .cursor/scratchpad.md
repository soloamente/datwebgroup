# Layout Component Split Plan

## Background and Motivation

The current layout component in `src/app/dashboard/sharer/layout.tsx` is marked with 'use client' directive, but we want to split it into separate client and server components for better performance and maintainability.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. The current layout uses client-side state management (useState, useEffect)
2. It contains interactive elements like sidebar toggle and logout functionality
3. It uses client-side routing and authentication
4. The component needs to be split while maintaining all functionality

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create a new client component for the sidebar

   - Move all interactive elements and state management
   - Success criteria: All sidebar functionality works independently

2. Create a new client component for the mobile overlay

   - Move mobile-specific overlay logic
   - Success criteria: Mobile overlay works correctly

3. Update the main layout to be a server component
   - Remove 'use client' directive
   - Import and use the new client components
   - Success criteria: Layout renders correctly with client components

## Project Status Board

- [x] Create new client components
  - [x] Created Sidebar.tsx
  - [x] Created MobileOverlay.tsx
  - [x] Created MobileMenuButton.tsx
  - [x] Created DashboardClient.tsx
- [x] Update main layout
- [ ] Test all functionality
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The implementation is complete. We have:

1. Split the layout into multiple client components
2. Created a client wrapper component (DashboardClient) to handle state management
3. Made the main layout a pure server component

Next steps:

1. Test the functionality to ensure everything works as expected
2. Verify mobile responsiveness
3. Check for any potential performance improvements

## Lessons

1. When splitting client and server components in Next.js:
   - Move all client-side state and effects to a dedicated client component
   - Keep the main layout as a server component for better performance
   - Use a client wrapper component to handle interactive features
2. Component organization:
   - Group related components in a components directory
   - Keep navigation data close to where it's used
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

# Admin Gradient Tracing Enhancement

## Background and Motivation

The current admin gradient tracing component only displays a single animated SVG path. The goal is to enhance the visual effect by adding multiple animated paths, similar to the reference image provided by the user, to create a more dynamic and visually appealing background for the admin login.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Designing multiple SVG paths that mimic the reference image's branching and intersecting lines
2. Ensuring the animation and gradients are consistent across all paths
3. Maintaining performance and code readability

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Analyze the reference image and sketch out the required SVG paths
   - Success criteria: At least 6-8 distinct paths that branch and intersect, similar to the reference
2. Implement the additional SVG paths in the component
   - Success criteria: All paths render and animate with the gradient
3. Test the visual effect and adjust path coordinates for best appearance
   - Success criteria: Visual result closely matches the reference image
4. Refine SVG paths to match the exact shape, angles, and layout of the lines in the provided image
   - Success criteria: SVG lines are pixel-perfect replicas of the reference image's lines
5. Implement unique behaviors for each SVG path (e.g., unique gradients, animations, or timing)
   - Success criteria: Each path has a distinct visual behavior, such as different animation timing, color, or gradient direction

## Project Status Board

- [x] Analyze reference and sketch SVG paths
- [x] Implement additional SVG paths
- [x] Test and adjust visual effect
- [x] Refine SVG paths to match image exactly
- [ ] Implement unique behaviors for each path

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

New requirement: Each SVG path should be treated as a different stroke and have unique behaviors (such as unique gradients, animation timing, or color). Next step is to implement these unique behaviors for each path.

## Lessons

- When adding multiple SVG paths, keep each path's coordinates clear and organized for maintainability.
- Test SVG rendering frequently to ensure paths align as intended.

# Admin Login Wrapper Component Split

## Background and Motivation

The current admin login wrapper component contains both the left side (image) and right side (login form) in a single component. We want to separate these into distinct components for better maintainability and reusability.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. The current component uses shared state and handlers
2. The layout uses responsive design with different behaviors for mobile and desktop
3. The motion animations need to be preserved
4. The components need to maintain their current styling and functionality

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create AdminLoginLeftSide Component

   - Move the left side image and container
   - Success criteria: Image displays correctly and maintains responsive behavior

2. Create AdminLoginRightSide Component

   - Move the right side content including forms and animations
   - Pass necessary props for state management
   - Success criteria: All login functionality works as before

3. Update AdminLoginWrapper
   - Import and use the new components
   - Pass necessary props
   - Success criteria: Layout works exactly as before with separated components

## Project Status Board

- [x] Create AdminLoginLeftSide component
- [x] Create AdminLoginRightSide component

4. Maintained all existing functionality and styling

Next steps:

1. Test the implementation to ensure everything works as expected
2. Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes
3. Check for any potential performance improvements

## Lessons

1. When splitting components:
   - Keep shared state in the parent component
   - Pass only necessary props to child components
   - Maintain consistent styling across components
2. For responsive design:
   - Keep media queries consistent
   - Test on multiple screen sizes
   - Ensure smooth transitions between breakpoints
3. For component organization:
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
   - Keep related components in the same directory
   - Document props and their purposes

# Session Handling Middleware Implementation

## Background and Motivation

We need to implement middleware to handle session validation and redirection for unauthenticated users. This will ensure that users are properly authenticated before accessing protected routes and are redirected to the login page when their session expires.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Need to handle both API routes and page routes
2. Need to check session validity using better-auth
3. Need to handle different types of authentication (admin vs regular users)
4. Need to exclude public routes from authentication checks

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Create middleware to check session status

   - Success Criteria: Middleware can detect if a session exists and is valid
   - Implementation: Use better-auth's session validation

2. [x] Implement route protection logic

   - Success Criteria: Protected routes redirect to login when no valid session
   - Implementation: Check request path and session status

3. [x] Add public route exclusions

   - Success Criteria: Public routes (login, register, etc.) are accessible without session
   - Implementation: Define list of public routes and exclude them from checks

4. [x] Add role-based access control
   - Success Criteria: Different user roles are redirected to appropriate login pages
   - Implementation: Check user role from session and redirect accordingly

## Project Status Board

- [x] Task 1: Create middleware to check session status
- [x] Task 2: Implement route protection logic
- [x] Task 3: Add public route exclusions
- [x] Task 4: Add role-based access control
- [x] Investigate why redirect for `mustChangePassword` is not working
  - [x] Add console.log statements to `src/middleware.ts` to check runtime values.
  - [x] Identify that `must_change_password` is not in the cookie due to `partialize` function in `src/app/api/auth.ts`.
  - [x] Update `partialize` function in `src/app/api/auth.ts` to include `must_change_password`.
  - [x] Add a condition to `src/middleware.ts` to prevent redirect loop to `/login/change-password`.
  - [x] Refactor middleware to correctly prioritize `mustChangePassword` and allow users to stay on the change password page if needed, fixing the redirect loop.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The middleware has been implemented with the following features:

1. Session validation using better-auth
2. Public route exclusions
3. Proper error handling and type safety
4. Redirect to login with callback URL and error parameters
5. Role-based access control for admin, sharer, and viewer roles
6. Proper redirection based on user roles
7. Specific redirection to admin login page for admin routes

The implementation is now complete. The middleware will:

1. Allow access to public routes without authentication
2. Check session validity for protected routes
3. Redirect to appropriate login pages based on user roles
4. Handle session expiration and errors gracefully
5. Redirect to admin login page when accessing admin routes without authentication

## Lessons

1. When working with better-auth, we need to use the `handler` method to get the session
2. Always add proper type definitions for session data
3. Include proper error handling and logging in middleware
4. Use URL search parameters to provide context for redirects
5. Define clear role-based route prefixes for better maintainability
6. Handle role validation before checking specific route access
7. Check route type (admin vs client) before session validation to ensure proper redirection
8. Use consistent redirection paths for different user roles and authentication states

- Ensure type consistency for shared data structures (like User objects) across different parts of the application (e.g., API layer vs. middleware). Mismatched types (e.g., boolean vs. number for the same field) can lead to subtle bugs and incorrect comparisons. Specifically, `1 === true` is `false` in JavaScript, which can cause issues if a numeric flag is compared directly to a boolean.

# Toaster Component Appearance Update

## Background and Motivation

The Toaster component's appearance has been updated to match the provided screenshot. We need to ensure that the new style is implemented correctly and that it meets the user's requirements.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Implementing the new Tailwind classes for a compact, modern, dark-background, rounded, and visually distinct style
2. Ensuring the Toaster component works correctly with the new style
3. User review and feedback on toast appearance

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Update Toaster component classes for modern, compact, dark, rounded toast style

   - Success criteria: Toaster component works correctly with the new style
   - Implementation: Use new Tailwind classes for the style

2. User review and feedback on toast appearance after removing 'richColors' prop

   - Success criteria: User review and feedback on toast appearance
   - Implementation: Trigger a toast in your app and let users review and provide feedback

## Project Status Board

- [x] Update Toaster component classes for modern, compact, dark, rounded toast style
- [ ] User review and feedback on toast appearance after removing 'richColors' prop

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The Toaster component has been updated with new Tailwind classes for a compact, modern, dark-background, rounded, and visually distinct style, closely matching the provided screenshot.
- Please trigger a toast in your app and review its appearance. Let me know if you want any further tweaks (e.g., color, spacing, font, icon style) or if this matches your requirements.
- The 'richColors' prop has been removed from the Toaster in layout.tsx. This should allow your custom Tailwind classes to take effect for all toast types, including success toasts. Please trigger a toast and confirm if the appearance now matches your expectations.

## Lessons

1. When updating component styles:
   - Ensure the new style is implemented correctly
   - Test the component with different scenarios
   - Use user feedback to refine the style

# Middleware Linter Fix

## Background and Motivation

A linter error `'userData.state.user' is possibly 'null'` was present in `src/middleware.ts`.
This error needed to be fixed to prevent potential runtime issues.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

The error occurred because `userData?.state?.user` could be `null`, and accessing `must_change_password` on `null` is not allowed.
The fix involves using optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access the property.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1.  Apply optional chaining to `must_change_password` access.
    - Success criteria: Linter error is resolved, and `mustChangePassword` is `undefined` if `user` is `null`.

## Project Status Board

- [x] Fix linter error in `src/middleware.ts`

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The linter error in `src/middleware.ts` has been fixed by applying optional chaining to the `must_change_password` property access.

## Lessons

- When accessing nested properties that might be null or undefined in TypeScript, use optional chaining (`?.`) to prevent runtime errors and satisfy the linter.
- Ensure type consistency for shared data structures (like User objects) across different parts of the application (e.g., API layer vs. middleware). Mismatched types (e.g., boolean vs. number for the same field) can lead to subtle bugs and incorrect comparisons. Specifically, `1 === true` is `false` in JavaScript, which can cause issues if a numeric flag is compared directly to a boolean.

# **[REQUEST]** Need specific backend password complexity rules to implement accurate frontend validation for the change password feature. The current error is "The password field format is invalid." and the frontend only checks for a minimum length of 8 characters.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- **[WAITING FOR INFO]** Still need the specific backend password complexity rules (e.g., must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, specific length constraints beyond minimum 8) to implement accurate frontend validation for the change password feature. The current error is "The password field format is invalid." The provided API documentation only details the request body structure, not the password content validation rules.

## Background and Motivation

The user encountered a backend error "The password field format is invalid." when trying to change their password. The frontend validation was only checking for a minimum length of 8 characters, while the backend enforced more specific complexity rules.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1.  Identifying the exact password complexity rules required by the backend.
2.  Implementing these rules in the frontend `ChangePasswordRightSide` component.
3.  Providing clear user feedback for each validation rule.
4.  Ensuring the submit button is disabled until all rules are met.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1.  [x] Obtain specific password complexity rules from the user (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 special char).
2.  [x] Implement a `validatePassword` function in `src/components/change-password/change-password-right-side.tsx` to check these rules.
3.  [x] Update the `handlePasswordChange` function to use the new validation logic and display errors.
4.  [x] Add dynamic UI hints below the password input to show the status of each validation rule.
5.  [x] Update the submit button's `disabled` state to reflect the new validation status.
6.  [ ] User to test the implemented validation changes and confirm the original issue is resolved.
7.  [x] Add optional `ruleset` prop to `PasswordInput` component (`src/components/login/password-input.tsx`).
8.  [x] Conditionally render an `InfoIcon` with a `Tooltip` in `PasswordInput` to display rules if `ruleset` is provided.
9.  [x] Pass the defined password rules from `ChangePasswordRightSide` to the `PasswordInput` for "Nuova Password".
10. [ ] User to test the new tooltip functionality for displaying password rules.
11. [x] Attempt to make tooltip animation smoother by adding `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out` to `TooltipContent` in `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx`.
12. [ ] User to test the updated tooltip animation smoothness.

## Project Status Board

- [x] Obtain password complexity rules from the user.
- [x] Implement `validatePassword` function with new rules (min length, uppercase, special character).
- [x] Integrate `validatePassword` into `handlePasswordChange` for error handling and toasts.
- [x] Add UI hints for individual password rules.
- [x] Update button `disabled` state based on all validation rules.
- [ ] **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Test password change functionality with new validation rules.
- [x] Modify `PasswordInput` to accept and display `ruleset` via `InfoIcon` and `Tooltip`.
- [x] Update `ChangePasswordRightSide` to provide `ruleset` to the relevant `PasswordInput`.
- [ ] **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Test the tooltip display for password rules on the "Nuova Password" field.
- [x] Modify `TooltipContent` in `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` to attempt smoother animation with Tailwind utility classes.
- [ ] **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Test the updated tooltip animation for smoothness.
- [ ] **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Check browser console logs for `password` and `passwordConfirmation` values when attempting to change password, and report back. (Previous task, now superseded by checking for the initial function call log)
- [ ] **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: After hard refresh, check if `"handlePasswordChange function called"` appears in console upon form submission, and report any other errors.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The password validation logic in `src/components/change-password/change-password-right-side.tsx` has been updated to include checks for at least one uppercase letter and one special character, in addition to the minimum 8-character length.
- UI hints have been added to guide the user, and the submit button will only be enabled when all criteria are met.
- The `PasswordInput` component now features an optional information icon next to the label. If a `ruleset` prop is provided (as it is for the "Nuova Password" field in the change password form), hovering this icon will display the password complexity rules in a tooltip.
- Added `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out` to `TooltipContent` in `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` in an attempt to make the show/hide animation smoother. The effectiveness of this depends on how `tailwindcss-animate` interacts with these standard transition utilities.
- **Please test the password validation changes thoroughly** to ensure the frontend validation works as expected and that valid passwords can now be set without the backend "invalid format" error.
- **Also, please test the new tooltip feature** on the "Nuova Password" input to ensure the rules are displayed correctly upon hovering the info icon, and **specifically check if the animation feels smoother**.
- User reported that the `console.log` statements for password values (added previously) are not appearing in the browser console.
- Added an additional `console.log("handlePasswordChange function called");` at the very beginning of the `handlePasswordChange` function in `src/components/change-password/change-password-right-side.tsx`. This is to determine if the function is being invoked at all when the form is submitted.
- Advised user to perform a hard refresh, open developer console, and then attempt password change, then report if the new log appears and if any other console errors are present.

## Lessons

- Frontend validation should ideally mirror backend validation rules to provide immediate feedback to the user and reduce unnecessary API calls.
- Clear and specific error messages for validation failures improve user experience.
- When dealing with string patterns (like special characters in passwords), ensure regex is correctly escaped for all intended characters.
- When encountering a "password field format is invalid" error from the backend, ensure frontend validation also checks for common requirements like at least one digit, in addition to length, uppercase, and special characters.
