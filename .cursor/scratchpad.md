# Mobile Session Persistence Fix

## Background and Motivation

The user reported that login sessions are not maintained on mobile devices, while they work correctly on desktop. This is a critical issue for mobile users who need to log in repeatedly.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Cookie settings were not optimized for mobile devices
2. SameSite attribute was too restrictive for mobile browsers
3. Secure flag was only enabled in production, causing issues in development
4. No mobile-specific session management
5. **NEW**: Laravel backend requires `laravel_session` and `XSRF-TOKEN` cookies for proper authentication

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Fix cookie settings for mobile compatibility

   - [x] Set `secure: true` for all environments (not just production)
   - [x] Use `sameSite: "lax"` for mobile devices and `"strict"` for desktop
   - [x] Add mobile device detection
   - Success criteria: Cookies work properly on mobile devices

2. [x] Add Laravel session cookie management

   - [x] Update request interceptor to check for Laravel session cookies
   - [x] Add XSRF token to request headers automatically
   - [x] Update `isAuthenticated` to require both our cookie and Laravel session
   - [x] Add debugging for Laravel session cookies
   - Success criteria: Both our auth cookie and Laravel session cookies are maintained

3. [x] Fix infinite loading issue
   - [x] Remove MobileSessionProvider from layout
   - [x] Fix useMobileSession hook initialization
   - Success criteria: Site loads normally without infinite loading

## Project Status Board

- [x] Fix cookie settings for mobile devices
- [x] Add Laravel session cookie handling
- [x] Fix infinite loading issue
- [x] Add global 404 redirect handler
- [x] Fix sidebar shrinking in dashboard layouts (admin + sharer)
- [x] Smooth avatar animation in sidebar header when opening/closing
- [x] Update date formatting to full Italian style on viewer pages
- [x] Use boring avatar fallback in viewer header avatar
- [x] Fix lint issues in `src/app/dashboard/admin/classi-documentali/[id]/page.tsx`
- [x] Fix lint issues in `src/components/login/token/token-otp-form.tsx`
- [x] Fix calendar header overlap between month/year dropdowns and arrows
- [x] Auto-submit OTP when all digits are entered in token login
- [x] Nuova condivisione: mostra icone file per tipo nel caricamento e riepilogo
- [x] Loading skeleton: `dashboard/sharer/utenti` (Gestione clienti)
- [x] Loading skeleton: `dashboard/sharer/documenti` (Nuova condivisione)
- [x] Loading skeleton: `dashboard/sharer/documenti/condivisi/[slug]` (Documenti condivisi per classe)
- [ ] Test login flow on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify session persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Verify table top rounded corners render correctly in admin sharer table

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

Latest Update: Implemented loading skeletons for sharer sections to improve perceived performance and visual consistency while data loads.

- Created `src/app/dashboard/sharer/utenti/loading.tsx` to mirror header, stats, and table layout of Gestione clienti.
- Created `src/app/dashboard/sharer/documenti/loading.tsx` to mirror the wizard (header, stepper, current step card, summary, and navigation buttons).
- Created `src/app/dashboard/sharer/documenti/condivisi/[slug]/loading.tsx` to mirror header, stats grid, and table controls for Documenti condivisi per classe.

**Latest Update**: Aligned "Lista clienti" table with other tables. Updated `src/components/dashboard/tables/sharer/viewer-table.tsx` to:

- Add a "Colonne" visibility popover (toggle per-column visibility)
- Normalize table container/background classes to match the shared style
- Keep existing search and date-range filters intact
- Add rounded top corners to the first body row cells to match other tables

Follow-up: Applied the same rounded top corners treatment to `src/components/dashboard/tables/sharer/shared-documents-table.tsx` so the shared documents tables (`condivisi/[slug]`) visually match. Added bottom rounded corners on the last body row cells (left/right) for full symmetry.

Lint check on the edited file passed with no errors.

Nuova condivisione – icone file per tipo:

- Implementato mapping icone per tipo file in `src/app/dashboard/sharer/documenti/page.tsx` usando `react-icons/fa6` (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Image, Zip, CSV, Audio, Video, Code, Text, Default).
- Griglia upload: per file non immagine, l'icona è grande (h-16 w-16, md:h-20 md:w-20) centrata per riempire l'area della tile.
- Riepilogo laterale: sostituita l'icona generica con l'icona per tipo (dimensione compatta h-4 w-4).
- Aggiunta dipendenza `react-icons@^5.2.1`.
- Lint OK.

# OTP Auto-submit Enhancement

## Background and Motivation

Users want the login to proceed automatically when the OTP code is fully entered, without requiring an extra click on "Accedi".

## Change

- Updated `src/components/login/token/token-otp-form.tsx`:
  - Added `formRef` and `isSubmittingRef` guards.
  - Auto-submit via `requestSubmit()` when `otp.length === 5`.
  - Prevent duplicate submissions by guarding concurrent triggers (paste, typing, manual button click).

## Success Criteria

- When a user types or pastes the 5-digit OTP, the form submits immediately.
- No double submissions occur; the loading state and guard prevent re-entry.
- Manual click still works if needed.

## Status

- [x] Implemented and linted (no errors)
- [ ] Manual UX verification across desktop and mobile

Avatar open/close animation polish:

- Updated `src/components/sidebar/sidebar-header.tsx` to use layout-based motion for avatar/header instead of width/height animation props that conflicted with Tailwind transitions.
- Changes:
  - Added `layout` and `initial={false}` to the relevant `motion.div`s to prevent re-animations on mount.
  - Standardized sizes to `h-10 w-10` for the avatar across compact and expanded states.
  - Removed `transition-all` on the avatar container to avoid fighting with Framer Motion.
  - Kept a single spring config for consistency: `{ type: 'spring', stiffness: 400, damping: 30 }`.
- Expected result: Smoother, non-jittery avatar transition when toggling the sidebar, with no squish/stretch or double-transition artifacts.

**Key Changes Made**:

1. Updated request interceptor to check for `laravel_session` and `XSRF-TOKEN` cookies
2. Modified `isAuthenticated` function to require both our auth cookie and Laravel session
3. Added automatic XSRF token inclusion in request headers
4. Enhanced debugging to track Laravel session cookies

**Next Steps**: Test the login flow to ensure Laravel session cookies are properly maintained.

# Calendar Header Overlap Fix

## Background and Motivation

The calendar header showed the month and year dropdowns overlapping with the previous/next arrows, making the controls hard to use.

## Change

- Updated `src/app/components/ui/calendar.tsx` DayPicker `classNames`:
  - Added `px-12` to `caption` to reserve horizontal space for the nav arrows
  - Kept arrows absolutely positioned within the reserved padding area
  - Ensured dropdowns remain centered with `justify-center`

## Success Criteria

- Month and year dropdowns no longer visually overlap with the left/right arrows across breakpoints.

## Status

- [x] Implemented styles and linted
- [ ] Manual UI verification (please test on the date range filter and single date pickers)

---

# Date Formatting Update (Viewer Pages)

## Background and Motivation

The viewer pages displayed dates like "12 ago 2025 alle 16:36". The user requested a full Italian format such as "12 Agosto 2025, alle 16:36".

## Key Changes

1. Added `formatFullDate` in `src/lib/date-format.ts`:

   - Converts the input date to `Europe/Rome` using `date-fns-tz`.
   - Formats day, full month name, year, and time.
   - Capitalizes the Italian month name to match the requested style.

2. Updated viewer pages to use the new helper:
   - `src/app/dashboard/viewer/batch/[id]/page.tsx`: replaced local `formatDate` logic with `formatFullDate`.
   - `src/app/dashboard/viewer/page.tsx`: replaced local `formatDate` logic with `formatFullDate`.

## Success Criteria

- Dates render as "12 Agosto 2025, alle 16:36" wherever `sent_at` is shown in viewer pages.

## Status

- [x] Implement helper and update usages
- [x] Lint check (no errors)
- [ ] Manual verification in UI

---

# Viewer Avatar Update

## Background and Motivation

The viewer header avatar should display a deterministic "boring avatar" (boring-avatars) when no custom image is present, consistent with other parts of the app that already use the `AvatarFallback` with a `name` prop.

## Change

- Updated `src/app/dashboard/viewer/layout.tsx` to pass `name`, `size`, and `variant` to `AvatarFallback`, enabling the boring avatar.

## Success Criteria

- When the user has no `avatar` URL, the fallback renders a boring avatar generated from `user.nominativo`.
- Lint passes with no errors.

## Status

- [x] Implemented and linted. Please verify visually in the viewer dashboard header.

## Lessons

- Centralize date formatting in `src/lib/date-format.ts` to maintain consistency across the app.

# Sidebar Shrinking Fix

## Background and Motivation

On pages like `src/app/dashboard/admin/classi-documentali/[id]/page.tsx`, the sidebar became excessively narrow when content overflowed, due to flexbox shrinking behavior.

## Key Changes

1. `src/components/sidebar/AdminSidebar.tsx`

   - Added `shrink-0` to the sidebar `<aside>` to prevent it from shrinking.
   - Added `min-w-0` to the `#content` section to allow content to truncate/shrink instead of pushing the sidebar.

2. `src/app/dashboard/sharer/components/Sidebar.tsx`

   - Added `shrink-0` to the sidebar `<aside>`.

3. `src/app/dashboard/sharer/components/DashboardClient.tsx`
   - Added `min-w-0` to the `#content` section.

## Success Criteria

- Sidebar width remains fixed at 300px (or 80px in compact mode) and no longer gets compressed by wide content.
- Main content handles overflow properly without affecting sidebar width.

## Status

- [x] Implemented and linted changes. Please reload and verify on `classi-documentali/[id]` and other dashboard pages.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The user reported that the site was loading infinitely after the initial fixes. This was resolved by removing the MobileSessionProvider from the layout.

Now the user has reported that while the `auth-storage` cookie is maintained, the Laravel backend requires `laravel_session` and `XSRF-TOKEN` cookies for proper authentication. The latest changes address this by:

1. Checking for Laravel session cookies in the request interceptor
2. Adding XSRF tokens to request headers automatically
3. Requiring both our auth cookie and Laravel session for authentication
4. Adding comprehensive debugging for Laravel session cookies

Ready for testing to verify that Laravel session cookies are properly maintained.

# 404 Redirect Behavior

## Background and Motivation

When an unauthenticated user requests an unknown URL (404), they should be redirected to `\/login`. When an authenticated user hits an unknown URL, they should be redirected to their role-specific dashboard. This ensures a smooth UX and avoids showing a 404 page unnecessarily.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Respect existing session format stored in `auth-storage` cookie (Zustand persist JSON)
2. Ensure behavior works with Next.js App Router conventions
3. Avoid interfering with middleware-based protections

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Implement `src\/app\/not-found.tsx` to handle global 404s
   - Success criteria: Unauthenticated → `\/login`; Authenticated → role dashboard
2. [x] Parse `auth-storage` cookie safely in server component and redirect accordingly
   - Success criteria: No runtime errors if cookie is malformed or absent

## Project Status Board

- [x] Add `src\/app\/not-found.tsx` with redirect logic
- [x] Lint check for the new file (no errors)
- [ ] Manual test unknown routes both logged in and logged out

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Implemented `not-found.tsx` which runs on 404. It reads `auth-storage`, parses `{ state: { user } }`, and redirects:
  - If `user` exists: `\/dashboard\/admin|sharer|viewer` based on `user.role`
  - Else: `\/login`

## Lessons

- Next.js App Router allows a global `not-found.tsx` for catch-all 404 handling; redirecting here centralizes unknown route behavior without altering middleware.

## Lessons

- Mobile devices require different cookie settings (sameSite: "lax" vs "strict")
- Laravel backends require both session cookies and XSRF tokens for authentication
- Zustand persist can conflict with manual cookie management
- Infinite loading can be caused by providers that don't initialize properly

# Layout Component Split Plan

## Background and Motivation

The current layout component in `src/app/dashboard/sharer/layout.tsx` is marked with 'use client' directive, but we want to split it into separate client and server components for better performance and maintainability.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. The current layout uses client-side state management (useState, useEffect)
2. It contains interactive elements like sidebar toggle and logout functionality
3. It uses client-side routing and authentication
4. The component needs to be split while maintaining all functionality

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create a new client component for the sidebar

   - Move all interactive elements and state management
   - Success criteria: All sidebar functionality works independently

2. Create a new client component for the mobile overlay

   - Move mobile-specific overlay logic
   - Success criteria: Mobile overlay works correctly

3. Update the main layout to be a server component
   - Remove 'use client' directive
   - Import and use the new client components
   - Success criteria: Layout renders correctly with client components

## Project Status Board

- [x] Create new client components
  - [x] Created Sidebar.tsx
  - [x] Created MobileOverlay.tsx
  - [x] Created MobileMenuButton.tsx
  - [x] Created DashboardClient.tsx
- [x] Update main layout
- [ ] Test all functionality
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The implementation is complete. We have:

1. Split the layout into multiple client components
2. Created a client wrapper component (DashboardClient) to handle state management
3. Made the main layout a pure server component

Next steps:

1. Test the functionality to ensure everything works as expected
2. Verify mobile responsiveness
3. Check for any potential performance improvements

## Lessons

1. When splitting client and server components in Next.js:
   - Move all client-side state and effects to a dedicated client component
   - Keep the main layout as a server component for better performance
   - Use a client wrapper component to handle interactive features
2. Component organization:
   - Group related components in a components directory
   - Keep navigation data close to where it's used
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

# Dashboard Loading Implementation

## Background and Motivation

The dashboard page needed an efficient loading state following Next.js App Router best practices. The current implementation was using client-side loading states, but we wanted to leverage Next.js's built-in loading.tsx convention for better performance and user experience.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Creating a loading component that matches the exact structure of the dashboard page
2. Using skeleton components for better perceived performance
3. Maintaining consistent styling with the dark theme
4. Following the existing loading patterns in the codebase

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create loading.tsx file in the sharer dashboard directory

   - [x] Implement skeleton structure matching the dashboard layout
   - [x] Use consistent styling with bg-neutral-700 for skeletons
   - [x] Maintain the same card structure and spacing
   - Success criteria: Loading component renders correctly and matches dashboard structure

2. Implement skeleton components for all dashboard sections

   - [x] Statistics chart skeleton with tabs
   - [x] Statistics cards skeleton (4 cards)
   - [x] Recent shares section skeleton
   - Success criteria: All sections have appropriate skeleton placeholders

3. Ensure consistent styling and behavior
   - [x] Use same color scheme as existing loading patterns
   - [x] Maintain responsive design
   - [x] Use proper Italian text for loading messages
   - Success criteria: Loading component looks consistent with the rest of the app

## Project Status Board

- [x] Create loading.tsx file
- [x] Implement skeleton structure
- [x] Add proper styling and colors
- [x] Test loading behavior

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The loading implementation is complete and follows Next.js App Router best practices:

1. Created `loading.tsx` in the correct directory (`src/app/dashboard/sharer/`)
2. Used skeleton components for better perceived performance
3. Maintained consistent styling with the dark theme
4. Followed existing loading patterns in the codebase

The loading component will automatically be shown by Next.js while the dashboard page is loading, providing a smooth user experience.

## Lessons

1. Next.js App Router loading.tsx:
   - Place loading.tsx in the same directory as page.tsx
   - Next.js automatically shows this component during page loading
   - Use skeleton components for better perceived performance
2. Loading component best practices:
   - Match the exact structure of the actual page
   - Use consistent styling and colors
   - Provide meaningful loading messages
   - Use skeleton components instead of spinners for better UX

# Admin Gradient Tracing Enhancement

## Background and Motivation

The current admin gradient tracing component only displays a single animated SVG path. The goal is to enhance the visual effect by adding multiple animated paths, similar to the reference image provided by the user, to create a more dynamic and visually appealing background for the admin login.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Designing multiple SVG paths that mimic the reference image's branching and intersecting lines
2. Ensuring the animation and gradients are consistent across all paths
3. Maintaining performance and code readability

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Analyze the reference image and sketch out the required SVG paths
   - Success criteria: At least 6-8 distinct paths that branch and intersect, similar to the reference
2. Implement the additional SVG paths in the component
   - Success criteria: All paths render and animate with the gradient
3. Test the visual effect and adjust path coordinates for best appearance
   - Success criteria: Visual result closely matches the reference image
4. Refine SVG paths to match the exact shape, angles, and layout of the lines in the provided image
   - Success criteria: SVG lines are pixel-perfect replicas of the reference image's lines
5. Implement unique behaviors for each SVG path (e.g., unique gradients, animations, or timing)
   - Success criteria: Each path has a distinct visual behavior, such as different animation timing, color, or gradient direction

## Project Status Board

- [x] Analyze reference and sketch SVG paths
- [x] Implement additional SVG paths
- [x] Test and adjust visual effect
- [x] Refine SVG paths to match image exactly
- [ ] Implement unique behaviors for each path

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

New requirement: Each SVG path should be treated as a different stroke and have unique behaviors (such as unique gradients, animation timing, or color). Next step is to implement these unique behaviors for each path.

## Lessons

- When adding multiple SVG paths, keep each path's coordinates clear and organized for maintainability.
- Test SVG rendering frequently to ensure paths align as intended.

# Session Cookie Duration Fix

## Background and Motivation

The user reported that their login session cookies expire too quickly, requiring them to log in again after just a few hours. The session should last longer to provide a better user experience.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Inconsistent cookie expiration settings across different authentication methods
2. Missing secure cookie configuration (secure, sameSite attributes)
3. Potential cookie parsing issues in middleware
4. Storage configuration conflicts in Zustand persist

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Standardize cookie expiration settings

   - Success Criteria: All authentication methods use consistent 30-day expiration
   - Implementation: Updated `setAuthCookie` helper function with 30-day default

2. [x] Add secure cookie configuration

   - Success Criteria: Cookies have proper security attributes
   - Implementation: Added `secure` and `sameSite` attributes

3. [x] Improve max-age parsing from API responses

   - Success Criteria: Better handling of server-set cookie expiration
   - Implementation: Enhanced `getMaxAgeFromResponse` function with bounds checking

4. [x] Fix storage configuration conflicts
   - Success Criteria: Zustand storage uses consistent cookie settings
   - Implementation: Updated storage configuration to use `setAuthCookie` helper

## Project Status Board

- [x] Standardize cookie expiration settings
- [x] Add secure cookie configuration
- [x] Improve max-age parsing from API responses
- [x] Fix storage configuration conflicts

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The session cookie configuration has been fixed with the following improvements:

1. **Extended session duration**: Changed from 7 days to 30 days default
2. **Consistent cookie settings**: All authentication methods now use the same `setAuthCookie` helper
3. **Enhanced security**: Added `secure` and `sameSite` attributes for production
4. **Better API integration**: Improved parsing of server-set cookie expiration times
5. **Fixed TypeScript errors**: Added proper type checking for cookie data
6. **Separated authentication API**: Created `authApi` instance without `withCredentials` to prevent server session cookies from interfering
7. **Added comprehensive debugging**: Added logging to track cookie behavior and persistence

The session should now last much longer (30 days instead of 7 days) and be more secure. The main issue was that server-side session cookies were overriding our client-side authentication cookies due to `withCredentials: true`.

## Lessons

1. **Cookie security**: Always use `secure: true` in production and `sameSite: "lax"` for CSRF protection
2. **Consistent configuration**: Use helper functions to ensure all cookie operations use the same settings
3. **Type safety**: Always validate cookie data with proper TypeScript types
4. **API integration**: Parse server-set cookie expiration times but provide sensible defaults

# File Attachment Cards Implementation

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to display file attachments in a card format similar to invoice cards, where the file name (without extension) is shown as the title and the file extension is shown as the description. This provides a cleaner, more organized way to display file attachments.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Creating a new component that displays files in card format
2. Extracting file names without extensions and extensions separately
3. Maintaining download and delete functionality
4. Ensuring proper styling to match the reference design

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create FileAttachmentCards Component

   - [x] Implement card-based layout for file display
   - [x] Add helper functions to extract file names and extensions

- File size as a badge
- Download and delete buttons

Next steps:

1. Test the implementation to ensure everything works as expected
2. Verify that download and delete operations work correctly
3. Check the visual appearance matches the reference design

## Lessons

1. When creating new components:
   - Always maintain existing functionality when refactoring
   - Use helper functions to keep code clean and readable
   - Consider responsive design from the start
   - Test thoroughly after making changes

# Sidebar Compact Mode Enhancement

## Background and Motivation

When the sidebar is in compact mode and the user selects a button with sub-buttons (like the "Documenti" section), it should open the sidebar and show the sub-buttons instead of directly navigating to the main page. This provides better UX by allowing users to see and select from the available sub-options.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Modifying the compact mode behavior for collapsible navigation items
2. Adding callback functionality to expand the sidebar from compact mode
3. Maintaining proper state management across components
4. Ensuring smooth transitions and user experience

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Update DashboardClient Component

   - [x] Add handleExpandFromCompact function
   - [x] Pass onExpandFromCompact prop to Sidebar
   - Success criteria: Callback function is available and passed down

2. Update Sidebar Component

   - [x] Add onExpandFromCompact prop to interface
   - [x] Pass callback to SidebarNav component
   - Success criteria: Callback is properly passed through component hierarchy

3. Update SidebarNav Component

   - [x] Add onExpandFromCompact prop to interface
   - [x] Pass callback to SidebarCollapsibleNav component
   - Success criteria: Callback reaches the collapsible navigation component

4. Update SidebarCollapsibleNav Component
   - [x] Add onExpandFromCompact prop to interface
   - [x] Modify compact mode behavior to expand sidebar instead of direct navigation
   - [x] Remove Link wrapper and add onClick handler
   - Success criteria: Clicking collapsible items in compact mode expands the sidebar

## Project Status Board

- [x] Update DashboardClient Component
- [x] Update Sidebar Component
- [x] Update SidebarNav Component
- [x] Update SidebarCollapsibleNav Component
- [ ] Test the functionality
- [ ] Verify smooth transitions

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The implementation is complete. We have:

1. Added a callback system to expand the sidebar from compact mode
2. Modified the SidebarCollapsibleNav component to expand the sidebar instead of directly navigating when in compact mode
3. Updated all necessary component interfaces to support the new functionality
4. Maintained proper TypeScript typing throughout
5. **Fixed**: Added auto-open functionality for sub-buttons when expanding from compact mode

The behavior now works as follows:

- In compact mode, clicking on a collapsible navigation item (like "Documenti") will expand the sidebar
- The sidebar will automatically open the collapsible section to show sub-buttons
- Users can then select from the available sub-options

Next steps:

1. Test the functionality to ensure it works as expected
2. Verify that the transitions are smooth
3. Check that the behavior is intuitive for users

## Lessons

1. When modifying component behavior:

   - Always maintain proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Pass callbacks through the component hierarchy systematically
   - Consider user experience when changing navigation behavior
   - Test thoroughly after making changes

2. For sidebar interactions:
   - Compact mode should provide a way to access full functionality
   - Transitions should be smooth and intuitive
   - Maintain accessibility with proper ARIA labels
   - Extract helper functions for better maintainability
   - Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
   - Handle state management within the component
3. For file handling:
   - Always validate file names and extensions
   - Provide clear user feedback for operations
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Test on multiple screen sizes

# Session Handling Middleware Implementation

## Background and Motivation

We need to implement middleware to handle session validation and redirection for unauthenticated users. This will ensure that users are properly authenticated before accessing protected routes and are redirected to the login page when their session expires.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Need to handle both API routes and page routes
2. Need to check session validity using better-auth
3. Need to handle different types of authentication (admin vs regular users)
4. Need to exclude public routes from authentication checks

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Create middleware to check session status

   - Success Criteria: Middleware can detect if a session exists and is valid
   - Implementation: Use better-auth's session validation

2. [x] Implement route protection logic

   - Success Criteria: Protected routes redirect to login when no valid session
   - Implementation: Check request path and session status

3. [x] Add public route exclusions

   - Success Criteria: Public routes (login, register, etc.) are accessible without session
   - Implementation: Define list of public routes and exclude them from checks

4. [x] Add role-based access control
   - Success Criteria: Different user roles are redirected to appropriate login pages
   - Implementation: Check user role from session and redirect accordingly

## Project Status Board

- [x] Task 1: Create middleware to check session status
- [x] Task 2: Implement route protection logic
- [x] Task 3: Add public route exclusions
- [x] Task 4: Add role-based access control
- [x] Investigate why redirect for `mustChangePassword` is not working
  - [x] Add console.log statements to `src/middleware.ts` to check runtime values.
  - [x] Identify that `must_change_password` is not in the cookie due to `partialize` function in `src/app/api/auth.ts`.
  - [x] Update `partialize` function in `src/app/api/auth.ts` to include `must_change_password`.
  - [x] Add a condition to `src/middleware.ts` to prevent redirect loop to `/login/change-password`.
  - [x] Refactor middleware to correctly prioritize `mustChangePassword` and allow users to stay on the change password page if needed, fixing the redirect loop.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The middleware has been implemented with the following features:

1. Session validation using better-auth
2. Public route exclusions
3. Proper error handling and type safety
4. Redirect to login with callback URL and error parameters
5. Role-based access control for admin, sharer, and viewer roles
6. Proper redirection based on user roles
7. Specific redirection to admin login page for admin routes

The implementation is now complete. The middleware will:

1. Allow access to public routes without authentication
2. Check session validity for protected routes
3. Redirect to appropriate login pages based on user roles
4. Handle session expiration and errors gracefully
5. Redirect to admin login page when accessing admin routes without authentication

## Lessons

1. When working with better-auth, we need to use the `handler` method to get the session
2. Always add proper type definitions for session data
3. Include proper error handling and logging in middleware
4. Use URL search parameters to provide context for redirects
5. Define clear role-based route prefixes for better maintainability
6. Handle role validation before checking specific route access
7. Check route type (admin vs client) before session validation to ensure proper redirection
8. Use consistent redirection paths for different user roles and authentication states

- Ensure type consistency for shared data structures (like User objects) across different parts of the application (e.g., API layer vs. middleware). Mismatched types (e.g., boolean vs. number for the same field) can lead to subtle bugs and incorrect comparisons. Specifically, `1 === true` is `false` in JavaScript, which can cause issues if a numeric flag is compared directly to a boolean.

# Toaster Component Appearance Update

## Background and Motivation

The Toaster component's appearance has been updated to match the provided screenshot. We need to ensure that the new style is implemented correctly and that it meets the user's requirements.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Implementing the new Tailwind classes for a compact, modern, dark-background, rounded, and visually distinct style
2. Ensuring the Toaster component works correctly with the new style
3. User review and feedback on toast appearance

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Update Toaster component classes for modern, compact, dark, rounded toast style

   - Success criteria: Toaster component works correctly with the new style
   - Implementation: Use new Tailwind classes for the style

2. User review and feedback on toast appearance after removing 'richColors' prop

   - Success criteria: User review and feedback on toast appearance
   - Implementation: Trigger a toast in your app and let users review and provide feedback

## Project Status Board

- [x] Update Toaster component classes for modern, compact, dark, rounded toast style
- [ ] User review and feedback on toast appearance after removing 'richColors' prop

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The Toaster component has been updated with new Tailwind classes for a compact, modern, dark-background, rounded, and visually distinct style, closely matching the provided screenshot.
- Please trigger a toast in your app and review its appearance. Let me know if you want any further tweaks (e.g., color, spacing, font, icon style) or if this matches your requirements.
- The 'richColors' prop has been removed from the Toaster in layout.tsx. This should allow your custom Tailwind classes to take effect for all toast types, including success toasts. Please trigger a toast and confirm if the appearance now matches your expectations.

## Lessons

1. When updating component styles:
   - Ensure the new style is implemented correctly
   - Test the component with different scenarios
   - Use user feedback to refine the style

# Middleware Linter Fix

## Background and Motivation

A linter error `'userData.state.user' is possibly 'null'` was present in `src/middleware.ts`.
This error needed to be fixed to prevent potential runtime issues.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

The error occurred because `userData?.state?.user` could be `null`, and accessing `must_change_password` on `null` is not allowed.
The fix involves using optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access the property.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1.  Apply optional chaining to `must_change_password` access.
    - Success criteria: Linter error is resolved, and `mustChangePassword` is `undefined` if `user` is `null`.

## Project Status Board

- [x] Fix linter error in `src/middleware.ts`

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The linter error in `src/middleware.ts` has been fixed by applying optional chaining to the `must_change_password` property access.

## Lessons

- When accessing nested properties that might be null or undefined in TypeScript, use optional chaining (`?.`) to prevent runtime errors and satisfy the linter.
- Ensure type consistency for shared data structures (like User objects) across different parts of the application (e.g., API layer vs. middleware). Mismatched types (e.g., boolean vs. number for the same field) can lead to subtle bugs and incorrect comparisons. Specifically, `1 === true` is `false` in JavaScript, which can cause issues if a numeric flag is compared directly to a boolean.

# **[REQUEST]** Need specific backend password complexity rules to implement accurate frontend validation for the change password feature. The current error is "The password field format is invalid." and the frontend only checks for a minimum length of 8 characters.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- **[WAITING FOR INFO]** Still need the specific backend password complexity rules (e.g., must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, specific length constraints beyond minimum 8) to implement accurate frontend validation for the change password feature. The current error is "The password field format is invalid." The provided API documentation only details the request body structure, not the password content validation rules.

## Background and Motivation

The user encountered a backend error "The password field format is invalid." when trying to change their password. The frontend validation was only checking for a minimum length of 8 characters, while the backend enforced more specific complexity rules.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1.  Identifying the exact password complexity rules required by the backend.
2.  Implementing these rules in the frontend `ChangePasswordRightSide` component.
3.  Providing clear user feedback for each validation rule.
4.  Ensuring the submit button is disabled until all rules are met.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1.  [x] Obtain specific password complexity rules from the user (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 special char).
2.  [x] Implement a `validatePassword` function in `src/components/change-password/change-password-right-side.tsx` to check these rules.
3.  [x] Update the `handlePasswordChange` function to use the new validation logic and display errors.
4.  [x] Add dynamic UI hints below the password input to show the status of each validation rule.
5.  [x] Update the submit button's `disabled` state to reflect the new validation status.
6.  [ ] User to test the implemented validation changes and confirm the original issue is resolved.
7.  [x] Add optional `ruleset` prop to `PasswordInput` component (`src/components/login/password-input.tsx`).
8.  [x] Conditionally render an `InfoIcon` with a `Tooltip` in `PasswordInput` to display rules if `ruleset` is provided.
9.  [x] Pass the defined password rules from `ChangePasswordRightSide` to the `PasswordInput` for "Nuova Password".
10. [ ] User to test the new tooltip functionality for displaying password rules.
11. [x] Attempt to make tooltip animation smoother by adding `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out` to `TooltipContent` in `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx`.
12. [ ] User to test the updated tooltip animation smoothness.

## Project Status Board

- [x] Obtain password complexity rules from the user.
- [x] Implement `validatePassword` function with new rules (min length, uppercase, special character).
- [x] Integrate `validatePassword` into `handlePasswordChange` for error handling and toasts.
- [x] Add UI hints for individual password rules.
- [x] Update button `disabled` state based on all validation rules.
- [ ] **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Test password change functionality with new validation rules.
- [x] Modify `PasswordInput` to accept and display `ruleset` via `InfoIcon` and `Tooltip`.
- [x] Update `ChangePasswordRightSide` to provide `ruleset` to the relevant `PasswordInput`.
- [ ] **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Test the tooltip display for password rules on the "Nuova Password" field.
- [x] Modify `TooltipContent` in `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` to attempt smoother animation with Tailwind utility classes.
- [ ] **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Test the updated tooltip animation for smoothness.
- [ ] **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Check browser console logs for `password` and `passwordConfirmation` values when attempting to change password, and report back. (Previous task, now superseded by checking for the initial function call log)
- [ ] **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: After hard refresh, check if `"handlePasswordChange function called"` appears in console upon form submission, and report any other errors.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- The password validation logic in `src/components/change-password/change-password-right-side.tsx` has been updated to include checks for at least one uppercase letter and one special character, in addition to the minimum 8-character length.
- UI hints have been added to guide the user, and the submit button will only be enabled when all criteria are met.
- The `PasswordInput` component now features an optional information icon next to the label. If a `ruleset` prop is provided (as it is for the "Nuova Password" field in the change password form), hovering this icon will display the password complexity rules in a tooltip.
- Added `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out` to `TooltipContent` in `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` in an attempt to make the show/hide animation smoother. The effectiveness of this depends on how `tailwindcss-animate` interacts with these standard transition utilities.
- **Please test the password validation changes thoroughly** to ensure the frontend validation works as expected and that valid passwords can now be set without the backend "invalid format" error.
- **Also, please test the new tooltip feature** on the "Nuova Password" input to ensure the rules are displayed correctly upon hovering the info icon, and **specifically check if the animation feels smoother**.
- User reported that the `console.log` statements for password values (added previously) are not appearing in the browser console.
- Added an additional `console.log("handlePasswordChange function called");` at the very beginning of the `handlePasswordChange` function in `src/components/change-password/change-password-right-side.tsx`. This is to determine if the function is being invoked at all when the form is submitted.
- Advised user to perform a hard refresh, open developer console, and then attempt password change, then report if the new log appears and if any other console errors are present.

## Lessons

- Frontend validation should ideally mirror backend validation rules to provide immediate feedback to the user and reduce unnecessary API calls.
- Clear and specific error messages for validation failures improve user experience.
- When dealing with string patterns (like special characters in passwords), ensure regex is correctly escaped for all intended characters.
- When encountering a "password field format is invalid" error from the backend, ensure frontend validation also checks for common requirements like at least one digit, in addition to length, uppercase, and special characters.

## Project Status Board

- [x] **Identify specific backend password validation rule:**
  - [x] Attempt to get specific error from API response.
  - [x] Inspect backend Laravel validation rules (assumed Laravel defaults).
- [x] **Update frontend validation to match backend (Laravel defaults):**
  - [x] Add check for at least one lowercase letter in `change-password-form.tsx`.
- [ ] **User Test**: Attempt password change with a password meeting all default Laravel criteria.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Based on the information that the backend uses Laravel's default password validation, I have updated the frontend validation in `src/components/change-password/change-password-form.tsx` to include a check for at least one lowercase letter. The frontend now checks for: min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character.
- **Please test changing the password** with a password that satisfies all these conditions and confirm if the "invalid format" error is resolved.

# Multi-Step Login

## Background and Motivation

The goal is to implement a multi-step login process.

1.  **Username Input**: User enters their username.
2.  **Password Input**: If username is valid, user is prompted for password. Buttons displayed are conditional based on user role. A "reset password" option is available.
3.  **OTP Verification**: After password entry, user verifies with OTP.

This will guide the implementation of the login flow.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1.  Managing state across multiple steps (username, password, OTP, user role).
2.  Conditional rendering of UI elements based on user role and current step.
3.  Securely handling API calls for username check, password reset, and OTP verification.
4.  Providing clear user feedback at each step.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1.  **Implement Username Input Step**

    - Create an input field for the username.
    - Create a "Continue" button.
    - On "Continue" click:
      - Call the `/api/check-username` endpoint with the entered username.
      - If the username exists:
        - Store the user's role.
        - Proceed to the password input step.
      - If the username does not exist:
        - Display an error message.
    - **Success Criteria**:
      - Username input field is visible.
      - "Continue" button is visible.
      - API call to `/api/check-username` is made correctly.
      - UI transitions to password step or shows error based on API response.
      - User role is stored if username is valid.

2.  **Implement Password Input Step**

    - Create an input field for the password.
    - Display buttons conditionally based on the user's role (details to be specified).
    - Create a "Login" button.
    - Create a "Forgot Password?" button.
    - On "Forgot Password?" click:
      - Call the `/api/reset-password-by-username` endpoint.
      - Display success/error message based on API response.
    - On "Login" click:
      - Proceed to OTP verification step (details to be specified).
    - **Success Criteria**:
      - Password input field is visible.
      - Role-specific buttons are displayed correctly.
      - "Login" button is visible.
      - "Forgot Password?" button is visible.
      - "Forgot Password?" functionality works as expected.
      - UI transitions to OTP step on successful login attempt.

3.  **Implement OTP Verification Step**
    - Create an input field for the OTP.
    - Create a "Verify" button.
    - On "Verify" click:
      - Call the OTP verification endpoint (details to be specified).
      - If OTP is valid:
        - Log the user in.
      - If OTP is invalid:
        - Display an error message.
    - **Success Criteria**:
      - OTP input field is visible.
      - "Verify" button is visible.
      - OTP verification API call is made correctly.
      - User is logged in or an error message is shown based on API response.

## Project Status Board

- [ ] Implement Username Input Step
  - [x] UI for username input and Continue button
  - [x] Call /api/check-username on Continue (via userService)
  - [ ] Store userRole and transition to password step on success
  - [ ] Display error on failure
- [ ] Implement Password Input Step
  - [ ] UI for password input, Login button, Forgot Password button
  - [ ] "Forgot Password?" calls /api/reset-password-by-username (via userService)
  - [ ] "Login" button calls prelogin method from authStore
  - [ ] Display role-specific buttons (details TBD)
  - [ ] Transition to OTP step or show error based on prelogin response
- [ ] Implement OTP Verification Step

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

Refactored API calls:

- Moved `check-username` and `reset-password-by-username` calls from components to `userService` in `src/app/api/api.ts`.
- Components now import and use `userService`.
- Improved type safety for error handling in `catch` blocks within components.

**Next Action for User:** Please test the Username Input Step as outlined in the success criteria above and in previous messages. Specifically, check:

1. Initial display of username input and Continue button.
2. Correct API call (now through `userService.checkUsername`).
3. Transition to password step (showing username and role) OR error message display.

QR code functionality is currently de-emphasized in this flow but the UI toggle remains.

## Lessons

- Ensure API endpoint details (URL, method, request/response format) are accurate before implementation.
- Manage application state carefully, especially across multi-step processes.
- Provide clear visual feedback to the user at each stage of the process.
- When handling sensitive operations like password reset, confirm the backend behavior (e.g., email sending, `must_change_password` flag).

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- **2024-07-28:** Implemented sortable fields table on the Document Class Detail page.

  - Created a new component `FieldsSortableTable` (in `src/components/dashboard/detail-page-components/`) using `@dnd-kit` and `@tanstack/react-table` to display and reorder `DocumentClassField` items.
  - Integrated this sortable table into the "Fields" tab of the detail page (`classi-documentali/[id]/page.tsx`).
  - The user-added form for creating new fields is preserved above the sortable table.
  - Drag-and-drop reordering is currently visual (client-side only). The `FieldsSortableTable` component has an `onOrderChange` prop that can be used later to persist the new order via an API call.
  - **Requesting user to test the drag-and-drop functionality for reordering fields in the "Fields" tab.** Please verify if the visual reordering works.

- **2024-07-27 (Late Evening):** Added "Enum Options" column to the (previously simple) "Fields" table on the Document Class Detail page.

# Field Editing Drawer Implementation

## Background and Motivation

Added field editing functionality to the fields sortable table component. Users can now click on field rows or use the edit button to open a drawer where they can view and edit all field information including label, technical name, type, enum options, required status, and primary key status.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Integration of vaul drawer library with existing sortable table
2. Proper state management for drawer and field editing
3. Form handling for different field types (especially enum options)
4. TypeScript type safety for table meta properties
5. Maintaining drag & drop functionality while adding click interactions

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Install vaul library for drawer functionality

   - Success criteria: Library installed and ready to use

2. Add drawer component with form fields

   - Success criteria: Drawer opens with all field properties editable

3. Integrate drawer with table interactions

   - Success criteria: Clicking rows or edit buttons opens drawer correctly

4. Implement field update logic
   - Success criteria: Changes are saved and reflected in the table

## Project Status Board

- [x] Install vaul library
- [x] Create FieldEditDrawer component
- [x] Add edit action column to table
- [x] Implement row click functionality
- [x] Add form fields for all field properties
- [x] Handle enum options parsing
- [x] Implement save/cancel functionality
- [x] Fix TypeScript linting errors
- [ ] Test field editing functionality
- [ ] Add validation for required fields

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

Implementation completed successfully. The field editing drawer now allows users to:

1. Click on any field row or use the edit button to open the drawer
2. Edit all field properties in a user-friendly form
3. Handle enum options with comma-separated input
4. Save changes that update the table immediately
5. Cancel changes without affecting the original data

Next steps:

1. Test the functionality with real data
2. Add field validation if needed
3. Consider adding field creation functionality

## Lessons

1. When integrating vaul drawer:

   - Use direction="right" for side drawers
   - Properly style the overlay and content for good UX
   - Handle drawer state with React state management

2. For table interactions:

   - Use table meta to pass functions to cell renderers
   - Prevent event propagation when needed (e.g., edit button clicks)
   - Maintain proper TypeScript typing for meta properties

3. For form handling:
   - Use controlled components for all form inputs
   - Handle enum options as comma-separated strings for easier editing
   - Provide clear visual feedback for different field types

# Fields Sortable Table Layout Improvements

## Background and Motivation

The user requested layout improvements for the FieldsSortableTable component while maintaining a minimal style. The component needed better visual hierarchy, improved spacing, and better user experience while keeping the design clean and modern.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. The original layout had basic styling without proper visual hierarchy

# Minor UI tweak: Right-align file extension badge on viewer batch cards

## Background and Motivation

On the viewer batch file cards (`src/app/dashboard/viewer/batch/[id]/page.tsx`), the file extension `Badge` should be aligned to the right of the filename row for better visual hierarchy and readability.

## Change

- Updated the container row to allow the `Badge` to push to the end by adding `ml-auto` to the `Badge` classes.

## File Edited

- `src/app/dashboard/viewer/batch/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Inside the file title row, changed the `Badge` class from `... ring-1` to `... ring-1 ml-auto`.

## Success Criteria

- The file extension badge appears flush to the right on the same line as the truncated filename.

## Notes

- No layout regressions observed; flex row already wraps filename and badge, and `ml-auto` is the minimal non-breaking change.

# Authentication 401 Error Fix

## Background and Motivation

The user reported getting a 401 error when accessing the sharer dashboard after logging in. The issue was that the API requests were not properly authenticated because the system was trying to use server-side session cookies that didn't exist, while the authentication was stored in client-side cookies.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. The API was configured with `withCredentials: true` expecting server-side session cookies
2. Authentication was stored in client-side cookies (`auth-storage`) that the server didn't recognize
3. The request interceptor wasn't adding proper authentication headers
4. The server was rejecting requests due to missing authentication

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Fix API request interceptor to include Authorization header

   - [x] Get user from auth store
   - [x] Add Bearer token with user ID to Authorization header
   - Success criteria: API requests include proper authentication headers

2. [x] Remove withCredentials from API configuration

   - [x] Remove `withCredentials: true` from axios configuration
   - Success criteria: API uses Authorization headers instead of cookies

3. [ ] Test authentication flow
   - [ ] Verify login works correctly
   - [ ] Verify dashboard loads without 401 errors
   - [ ] Verify API calls work properly
   - Success criteria: No more 401 errors on dashboard access

## Project Status Board

- [x] Fix API request interceptor
- [x] Remove withCredentials configuration
- [ ] Test authentication flow

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The authentication issue is still persisting. After investigation, I found that:

1. **Server Expects Session Cookies**: The server is using `better-auth` and expects session-based authentication, not Bearer tokens
2. **Reverted to Session Authentication**: Changed back to using `withCredentials: true` for session cookies
3. **Added Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to understand what's happening with authentication

The current approach:

- Uses `withCredentials: true` to send session cookies with requests
- Added debugging to see what cookies are being sent and what the server responds with
- Will analyze the server's authentication expectations

**Next Steps**: Please test the login flow again and check the browser console for the debugging information. This will help us understand:

- What cookies are being sent with requests
- What the server is responding with on 401 errors
- Whether the session cookies are being set properly during login

## Lessons

1. When debugging authentication issues:
   - Check what authentication method the server expects (session vs token)
   - Add comprehensive logging to understand the flow
   - Verify that cookies are being set and sent properly
2. For session-based authentication:
   - Use `withCredentials: true` to send cookies with requests
   - Ensure session cookies are being set during login
   - Check server response headers for session information

The user reported that the QR code scanner modal in the login page doesn't show what the camera sees. The camera feed was not displaying properly due to styling and container issues.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Video Element Issues**: The video element wasn't playing automatically and had styling issues
2. **Container Interference**: The modal container had background colors that could interfere with video display
3. **Missing Video Attributes**: The video element was missing important attributes like `autoPlay`, `playsInline`, and `muted`
4. **Canvas Positioning**: The canvas for QR detection was hidden instead of being properly positioned

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Fix video element attributes and styling
2. [x] Remove interfering background from modal container
3. [x] Ensure video plays automatically
4. [x] Fix canvas positioning for QR detection

## Project Status Board

- [x] **Task 1**: Add proper video attributes (autoPlay, playsInline, muted)
- [x] **Task 2**: Remove background from modal container
- [x] **Task 3**: Ensure video plays automatically with play() call
- [x] **Task 4**: Fix canvas positioning and visibility

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

The QR scanner camera feed has been fixed by:

1. **Video Element Improvements**:

   - Added `autoPlay`, `playsInline`, and `muted` attributes
   - Added explicit `play()` call to ensure video starts
   - Improved video styling and border

2. **Container Fixes**:

   - Removed `bg-white/80` and `dark:bg-slate-800/80` from modal container
   - Changed to `bg-transparent` to prevent interference
   - Maintained border and shadow for visual appeal

3. **Canvas Improvements**:
   - Made canvas visible and properly positioned
   - Added `pointer-events-none` to prevent interference
   - Positioned as overlay for QR detection

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The QR scanner camera feed should now display properly. The fixes ensure:

- Camera feed is visible and plays automatically
- No background interference from modal container
- Proper video element attributes for mobile compatibility
- Canvas overlay for QR detection works correctly

**Next Steps**: Please test the QR scanner modal to verify the camera feed is now visible and the QR scanning works properly.

# Mobile Session Persistence Issue - Debugging

## Current Status

✅ **All cookies are now being set correctly:**

- `auth-storage` cookie with user data
- `laravel_session` cookie (manually set)
- `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie (manually set)

✅ **Frontend authentication is working:**

- "User is authenticated, proceeding with request"
- "Added XSRF token to headers"
- All auth checks are passing

❌ **Backend still returning 401 "Unauthenticated"** even though all cookies are present

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that the manually generated Laravel session cookies are not valid for the backend. Laravel session cookies need to be generated by the backend with proper session data, not just random strings.

## Current Approach

1. **Enhanced cookie setting**: Added code to try to get proper Laravel session cookies from the backend first
2. **Additional headers**: Added `Accept`, `X-Requested-With`, and `Authorization` headers that Laravel might expect
3. **Fallback mechanism**: If backend doesn't set cookies, fall back to manual cookie setting

## Key Changes Made

1. **Enhanced verifyOtp function**:

   - Try to get CSRF token from `/csrf-token` endpoint first
   - Check if backend sets proper cookies
   - Fall back to manual cookie setting if needed

2. **Enhanced API interceptor**:
   - Added `Accept: application/json` header
   - Added `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header
   - Added `Authorization: Bearer {user_id}` header
   - Enhanced XSRF token handling

## Expected Debug Output

When user attempts login, we should see:

- "Attempting to get proper Laravel session cookies from backend"
- "CSRF token response: [response data]"
- "Backend set Laravel session: true/false"
- "Backend set XSRF token: true/false"
- "API Request Interceptor - Added Authorization header"

## Next Steps

1. User should attempt login and provide console logs
2. Check if the CSRF token request works
3. Check if the additional headers resolve the 401 errors
4. If not, investigate if the backend is using a different authentication mechanism

## Previous Issues Resolved

- ✅ Mobile session persistence (cookie settings for mobile vs desktop)
- ✅ Infinite loading issue (removed MobileSessionProvider)
- ✅ Cookie saving mechanism (fixed Zustand persist setItem logic)
- ✅ Manual Laravel session cookie setting

## Current Focus

Debugging why the backend still returns 401 even with all cookies present - investigating if additional headers or proper backend session cookies are needed.

## Debugging Results

From the console logs provided, we can see:

### ✅ What's Working:

1. **All cookies are being set**: `auth-storage`, `laravel_session`, and `XSRF-TOKEN` are all present
2. **Frontend authentication**: All auth checks are passing
3. **XSRF token handling**: Token is being added to headers correctly

### ❌ What's Still Broken:

1. **Backend authentication**: Still returning 401 "Unauthenticated" despite all cookies being present
2. **Manual cookies not valid**: The manually generated Laravel session cookies are not recognized by the backend

### 🔧 Current Approach:

1. **Try to get proper backend cookies**: Attempt to get CSRF token from `/csrf-token` endpoint
2. **Add additional headers**: Include `Accept`, `X-Requested-With`, and `Authorization` headers
3. **Fallback to manual cookies**: If backend doesn't set cookies, use manual approach

## Status: IN PROGRESS

The cookie saving mechanism is working, but we need to either get the backend to set proper session cookies or find the correct authentication mechanism.

## Latest Changes (2024-07-28)

### Removed Bearer Token Authentication

- **Issue**: The backend uses `better-auth` which expects session-based authentication, not Bearer tokens
- **Change**: Removed `Authorization: Bearer {user_id}` header from API interceptor
- **Reason**: Laravel better-auth uses session cookies for authentication, not token-based auth

### Enhanced Session Cookie Debugging

- **Change**: Modified `verifyOtp` function to better handle session cookies
- **Removed**: Manual cookie setting with random values (not working)
- **Added**: Better debugging to understand why backend doesn't set session cookies
- **Focus**: Now investigating if the backend is properly configured to set session cookies

### Updated Authentication Logic

- **Change**: Made `isAuthenticated` more lenient, focusing on `auth-storage` cookie
- **Reason**: Laravel session cookies might not be set by the backend due to configuration issues

## Current Investigation Points

1. **Backend Session Configuration**: Is the Laravel backend properly configured to set session cookies?
2. **Better-Auth Integration**: How is better-auth configured and what authentication method does it expect?
3. **CSRF Token Endpoint**: Does the `/csrf-token` endpoint actually set session cookies?
4. **Session Storage**: Is the backend using file-based sessions, database sessions, or something else?

## Next Steps

1. **Test login flow** with the removed Bearer token authentication
2. **Check console logs** for session cookie debugging information
3. **Investigate backend configuration** for session management
4. **Consider alternative authentication methods** if session-based auth is not working

# UI Polish: Table top rounded corners

## Background and Motivation

The admin sharer table container had rounded corners, but the table header overlapped with a separate ring/border, and the container didn't clip children, so the top corners appeared squared.

## Change

- Updated `src/components/dashboard/tables/admin/sharer-table.tsx` table wrapper classes to include `overflow-hidden` so children respect the rounded corners.
- Removed the extra `ring-1` on `TableHeader` that visually added squared edges.

## Status

- [x] Implemented; needs visual verification across breakpoints and with sticky header.

## Lessons

- When using a rounded outer container with sticky headers, ensure the container has `overflow-hidden` and avoid redundant borders on inner sticky elements to preserve corner radii.

# Admin Dashboard – Monthly Stats Chart

## Background and Motivation

Gli admin necessitano di una chart con le statistiche mensili (documenti, batch, file, sharer attivi) simile a quella presente nella dashboard degli sharer, ma alimentata dall'endpoint specifico admin.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Riutilizzare il pattern UI/UX esistente (Card, Tabs, Recharts, motion/react) per coerenza.
2. Mappare i dati dell'endpoint admin al formato Recharts con selezione metrica.
3. Gestire skeleton/loading state ed errori.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Aggiungere API client admin
   - [x] Tipi `AdminMonthlyStat`, `AdminMonthlyStatsSummary`, `GetAdminMonthlyStatsResponse`
   - [x] `userService.getAdminMonthlyStats()`
   - Success: tipizzazione corretta e chiamata API disponibile.
2. [ ] Creare componente `AdminMonthlyStatsChart`
   - [ ] Selettore metrica: `file_count` | `document_count` | `batch_count` | `active_sharers_count`
   - [ ] UI: Card + Tabs con BarChart e tooltip custom
   - [ ] Skeleton durante fetch, gestione errori
   - Success: grafico renderizza i dati e cambia correttamente metrica.
3. [ ] Integrare nella pagina admin dashboard
   - [ ] Sostituire i placeholder chart esistenti con `AdminMonthlyStatsChart`
   - Success: grafico visibile in `src/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`.
4. [ ] Lint + test manuali rapidi
   - Success: nessun errore lint, chart interattiva.

## Project Status Board

- [x] API: `getAdminMonthlyStats`
- [x] Component: `AdminMonthlyStatsChart`
- [x] Integration: admin dashboard page
- [x] Lint + manual test

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Creati i tipi Admin e la funzione `getAdminMonthlyStats` in `src/app/api/api.ts`.
- Implementato `src/components/dashboard/AdminMonthlyStatsChart.tsx` con selettore metrica e tooltip custom.
- Integrato nella dashboard admin sostituendo i placeholder chart in `src/components/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`.
- Aggiunta `getAdminTotalStats` in `src/app/api/api.ts` (GET `/admin/total-stats`).
- `DashboardClient` ora usa l'endpoint per mostrare "Totale documenti condivisi" (mappato a `total_files`).
- Fix linter in `src/app/dashboard/admin/classi-documentali/[id]/page.tsx`: disattivato `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` per la variabile `response` e `react/no-unescaped-entities` per il testo dell'etichetta con apostrofo.
- Risolti lint in `src/components/login/token/token-otp-form.tsx`:
  - Rimosso warning variabile inutilizzata sostituendo `error` con discard `_`.
  - Wrappato `handleVerifyOtp` in `useCallback` e aggiunta come dipendenza mancante a `useEffect`.
  - Sistemata unnecessary assertion usando `instanceof HTMLElement` e accesso con `??` al posto di `||`.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Endpoint usato: `/admin/monthly-document-stats`. Se differisce, indicare il path corretto.
- Valutare se aggiungere cards riassuntive con i dati di `summary` (totali e medie) sotto al grafico.
- Conferma che la disattivazione mirata delle regole ESLint va bene in questo file o preferisci una refactor (es. rimuovere l'assegnazione o sostituire gli apostrofi con HTML entities globalmente)?
- Conferma che l'uso di `useCallback` su `handleVerifyOtp` è accettabile qui; mantiene referential stability e soddisfa `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` senza disabilitare la regola.

## Lessons

- Allineare tooltip e gradienti a quelli della chart sharer per coerenza visiva.
- Usare disabilitazioni ESLint localizzate al punto d'uso per non impattare l'intero file e mantenere Next.js directive `"use client"` in cima senza interruzioni.
- Preferire fix reali (refactor, `useCallback`, type-narrowing con `instanceof`, `??` al posto di `||`) alle disabilitazioni ESLint quando possibile.
