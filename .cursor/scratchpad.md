# Layout Component Split Plan

## Background and Motivation

The current layout component in `src/app/dashboard/sharer/layout.tsx` is marked with 'use client' directive, but we want to split it into separate client and server components for better performance and maintainability.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. The current layout uses client-side state management (useState, useEffect)
2. It contains interactive elements like sidebar toggle and logout functionality
3. It uses client-side routing and authentication
4. The component needs to be split while maintaining all functionality

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create a new client component for the sidebar

   - Move all interactive elements and state management
   - Success criteria: All sidebar functionality works independently

2. Create a new client component for the mobile overlay

   - Move mobile-specific overlay logic
   - Success criteria: Mobile overlay works correctly

3. Update the main layout to be a server component
   - Remove 'use client' directive
   - Import and use the new client components
   - Success criteria: Layout renders correctly with client components

## Project Status Board

- [x] Create new client components
  - [x] Created Sidebar.tsx
  - [x] Created MobileOverlay.tsx
  - [x] Created MobileMenuButton.tsx
  - [x] Created DashboardClient.tsx
- [x] Update main layout
- [ ] Test all functionality
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The implementation is complete. We have:

1. Split the layout into multiple client components
2. Created a client wrapper component (DashboardClient) to handle state management
3. Made the main layout a pure server component

Next steps:

1. Test the functionality to ensure everything works as expected
2. Verify mobile responsiveness
3. Check for any potential performance improvements

## Lessons

1. When splitting client and server components in Next.js:
   - Move all client-side state and effects to a dedicated client component
   - Keep the main layout as a server component for better performance
   - Use a client wrapper component to handle interactive features
2. Component organization:
   - Group related components in a components directory
   - Keep navigation data close to where it's used
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

# QR Code Login Implementation

## Background and Motivation

We need to add a QR code login option to the admin login page to provide an alternative authentication method. This will enhance security and user experience by allowing administrators to log in using a QR code.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Integration of QR code scanner component with existing login flow
2. Handling camera permissions and device compatibility
3. Managing state between QR scan and login process
4. Ensuring proper cleanup of camera resources
5. Maintaining consistent UI/UX with existing login form

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create QR Scanner Component

   - [x] Implement basic QR scanner functionality
   - [x] Add proper error handling for camera permissions
   - [x] Add loading states and user feedback
   - Success criteria: QR scanner works reliably and handles errors gracefully

2. Add QR Login Button to Admin Login

   - [x] Add button to toggle between regular login and QR login
   - [x] Implement state management for login mode
   - [x] Style button to match existing UI
   - Success criteria: Button is visible and toggles login mode correctly

3. Integrate QR Scanner with Login Flow

   - [x] Handle QR code data format
   - [ ] Implement login logic for QR code data
   - [x] Add proper error handling
   - Success criteria: QR code login works end-to-end

4. Add UI/UX Improvements
   - [x] Add loading states
   - [x] Add error messages
   - [x] Add success feedback
   - Success criteria: User experience is smooth and intuitive

## Project Status Board

- [x] Create QR Scanner Component
- [x] Add QR Login Button
- [ ] Integrate with Login Flow
- [x] Add UI/UX Improvements

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The basic implementation is complete. We have:

1. Created a QR scanner component with proper error handling and loading states
2. Added a toggle button to switch between credentials and QR code login
3. Integrated the QR scanner into the admin login wrapper
4. Added proper error handling and user feedback

Next steps:

1. Implement the actual login logic for QR code data
2. Test the implementation thoroughly
3. Add any necessary security measures

## Lessons

1. When working with camera access:
   - Always request permissions explicitly
   - Handle cases where camera is not available
   - Clean up camera resources when component unmounts
2. For QR code scanning:
   - Validate QR code data format
   - Handle scanning errors gracefully
   - Provide clear feedback to users
3. For UI/UX:
   - Use loading states to indicate progress
   - Show clear error messages
   - Provide smooth transitions between modes
