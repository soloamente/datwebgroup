# Layout Component Split Plan

## Background and Motivation

The current layout component in `src/app/dashboard/sharer/layout.tsx` is marked with 'use client' directive, but we want to split it into separate client and server components for better performance and maintainability.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. The current layout uses client-side state management (useState, useEffect)
2. It contains interactive elements like sidebar toggle and logout functionality
3. It uses client-side routing and authentication
4. The component needs to be split while maintaining all functionality

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create a new client component for the sidebar

   - Move all interactive elements and state management
   - Success criteria: All sidebar functionality works independently

2. Create a new client component for the mobile overlay

   - Move mobile-specific overlay logic
   - Success criteria: Mobile overlay works correctly

3. Update the main layout to be a server component
   - Remove 'use client' directive
   - Import and use the new client components
   - Success criteria: Layout renders correctly with client components

## Project Status Board

- [x] Create new client components
  - [x] Created Sidebar.tsx
  - [x] Created MobileOverlay.tsx
  - [x] Created MobileMenuButton.tsx
  - [x] Created DashboardClient.tsx
- [x] Update main layout
- [ ] Test all functionality
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

The implementation is complete. We have:

1. Split the layout into multiple client components
2. Created a client wrapper component (DashboardClient) to handle state management
3. Made the main layout a pure server component

Next steps:

1. Test the functionality to ensure everything works as expected
2. Verify mobile responsiveness
3. Check for any potential performance improvements

## Lessons

1. When splitting client and server components in Next.js:
   - Move all client-side state and effects to a dedicated client component
   - Keep the main layout as a server component for better performance
   - Use a client wrapper component to handle interactive features
2. Component organization:
   - Group related components in a components directory
   - Keep navigation data close to where it's used
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

# Admin Gradient Tracing Enhancement

## Background and Motivation

The current admin gradient tracing component only displays a single animated SVG path. The goal is to enhance the visual effect by adding multiple animated paths, similar to the reference image provided by the user, to create a more dynamic and visually appealing background for the admin login.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Designing multiple SVG paths that mimic the reference image's branching and intersecting lines
2. Ensuring the animation and gradients are consistent across all paths
3. Maintaining performance and code readability

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Analyze the reference image and sketch out the required SVG paths
   - Success criteria: At least 6-8 distinct paths that branch and intersect, similar to the reference
2. Implement the additional SVG paths in the component
   - Success criteria: All paths render and animate with the gradient
3. Test the visual effect and adjust path coordinates for best appearance
   - Success criteria: Visual result closely matches the reference image
4. Refine SVG paths to match the exact shape, angles, and layout of the lines in the provided image
   - Success criteria: SVG lines are pixel-perfect replicas of the reference image's lines
5. Implement unique behaviors for each SVG path (e.g., unique gradients, animations, or timing)
   - Success criteria: Each path has a distinct visual behavior, such as different animation timing, color, or gradient direction

## Project Status Board

- [x] Analyze reference and sketch SVG paths
- [x] Implement additional SVG paths
- [x] Test and adjust visual effect
- [x] Refine SVG paths to match image exactly
- [ ] Implement unique behaviors for each path

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

New requirement: Each SVG path should be treated as a different stroke and have unique behaviors (such as unique gradients, animation timing, or color). Next step is to implement these unique behaviors for each path.

## Lessons

- When adding multiple SVG paths, keep each path's coordinates clear and organized for maintainability.
- Test SVG rendering frequently to ensure paths align as intended.

# Admin Login Wrapper Component Split

## Background and Motivation

The current admin login wrapper component contains both the left side (image) and right side (login form) in a single component. We want to separate these into distinct components for better maintainability and reusability.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

2. The layout uses responsive design with different behaviors for mobile and desktop
3. The motion animations need to be preserved
4. The components need to maintain their current styling and functionality

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create AdminLoginLeftSide Component

   - Move the left side image and container
   - Success criteria: Image displays correctly and maintains responsive behavior

2. Create AdminLoginRightSide Component

   - Move the right side content including forms and animations
   - Pass necessary props for state management
   - Success criteria: All login functionality works as before

3. Update AdminLoginWrapper
   - Import and use the new components
   - Pass necessary props
   - Success criteria: Layout works exactly as before with separated components

## Project Status Board

- [x] Create AdminLoginLeftSide component
- [x] Create AdminLoginRightSide component
- [x] Update AdminLoginWrapper
